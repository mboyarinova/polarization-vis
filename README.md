# Political Polarization in the U.S

This D3.js project was developed by me, Lily Li and Jacob Spiegel for the Data Visualization class at the University of Chicago.

## About

This visualization attempts to answer an important question: is polarization between Democrats and Republicans increasing? We also address two follow-up questions: How is political polarization changing over time? Which states are becoming more extreme and moving further away from the center?

## Setup

To run this project, install it locally (in the project directory) using npm: 

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## Our work

Our team's work consisted in:

* coming up with an original visualization concept
* designing the visualization
* preparing the data in Python
* writing d3 code in src/index.js and src/utils.js files
